## Description

The Teaching Resources Library is application to save and organize teaching resources. This application assists teachers in finding and remembering digital teaching resources and prevents them from becoming overwhelmed with the amount of online resources available to use in their practice. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, many teachers began an abrupt shift to teaching online. Vendors, organizations, and teachers began sharing resources, teaching tools, and digital materials, but there was no central location to find and keyword-search for resources, and no easy way for teachers to save favorite resources.
